Sample Programs
----------------

1. hello.prg

  When loaded at address $0300, this program will print "Hello, 6502 World!" in
  infinite loop.

2. echo_poll.prg

  When loaded at address $0300, this program will echo back to the console
  anything typed.

Both hello.prg and echo_poll.prg were assembled with the Ophis assembler:

3. echo_irq.rom

  This is another echo program, and behaves identically to echo_poll.prg,
  except it is interrupt-driven. This ROM can be loaded either through the
  "File->Load ROM..." menu in Symon, or by specifying the path to
  "echo_irq.rom" with the "-jar" command line option when running Symon,
  for example: `java -jar symon-1.3.2.jar -rom samples/echo_irq.rom`

4. ehbasic.rom

   This is Lee Davison's Enhanced 6502 BASIC.

   The EhBASIC ROM can be loaded either through the "File -> Load ROM..."
   menu in Symon, or by specifying the path to "ehbasic.rom" with
   the "-jar" command line option when running Symon, for example:
   `java -jar symon-1.3.2.jar -rom samples/ehbasic.rom`

   Click the "Run" button and EhBASIC should automatically start running.

   Type 'C' to do a cold start.

   Then, type '49152' (without the quotes) when prompted for the memory size.

   More information can be found in the 'ehbasic' directory, and by visiting
   the EhBASIC web page:
